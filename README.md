# set-solver
A computer vision python web app using streamlit and openCV that solves the card game [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).

## Usage
1. Go to https://setcardgamesolver-cqcwmbfqnrgtv4ohvo4uk8.streamlit.app/
   - If no one has accessed the URL for a while, you'll need to "wake it up." It should only take a couple of seconds.
2. Upload an image with cards from Set.
   - For best results, take the photo in a well-lit environment while avoiding glare.
   Lighting conditions are fortunately not that strict, though---image quality is more important, but any modern phone camera provides plenty of resolution.
3. View the current sets.

## Example
If you don't own Set, you can test the solver yourself by uploading [test.jpg](https://github.com/charleskolozsvary/set-solver/blob/main/test.jpg) in this repository
or take a look at [exampleoutput.pdf](https://github.com/charleskolozsvary/set-solver/blob/main/exampleoutput.pdf).
